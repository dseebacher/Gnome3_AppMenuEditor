A GUI for manipulating the Application menu of gnome 3, because it is not as easy as it should be.

Current State:
Main features are complete. You can add/remove/edit desktop entries! Does not support multi-language entry editing, as that is a very complex side of desktop entries that I really don't need.
Going to clean up the interface, and perhaps construct an Arch AUR package so I can just install it easily next time.

Fun Tips:
If you want to use another '.desktop' directory besides the standard '/usr/share/applications/', you can just pass in the absolute path to the new directory as a command-line parameter.
